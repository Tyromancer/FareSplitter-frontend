# Style guideline

To maintain a concise and consistent code base, we’ll be trying to adopt a coding style that is loose to allow easy contribution, but also tidy. Generally, you should be following the style guide for that language closely, though you can potentially deviate within reason.

The main languages that undergo style critiques on code contributions such as TODO may be added to ensure proper style on contributions.

Code should mainly be “self-commenting” in that keeping code paths and then commenting the functions as necessary. At a minimum, all functions should have comments that give a short description of function usage, parameter details and return details (giving expected types if it’s a dynamic language). All the newly added functions should be clear and easy to understand. Contributors are encouraged to write in the same style with the existing functions both front-end and back-end.

## How to submit issues
All the contributors can submit their concerns directly to us through our discord server(https://discord.gg/QVmHWK7s). This includes any problem in function use, bugs, request for demo of the existing project and anything with coding styles.

## Reference 
This Style Guideline is also open source and modified from Submitty Style Guideline.
